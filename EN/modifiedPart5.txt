my
#UNK#
on
the
#UNK#
time

#UNK#
over
me
to
#UNK#
#UNK#
.

–
We
ate
on
the
outside
patio
area
for
dinner
on
a
Saturday
night
.

#UNK#
my
happy
#UNK#
upon
#UNK#
that
the
#UNK#
are
only
the
#UNK#
thing
about
Ray's
!

The
bread
was
#UNK#
,
the
salad
was
overpriced
and
empty
.

They
have
a
huge
selection
of
different
#UNK#
#UNK#
and
all
of
their
salads
are
great
.

A
#UNK#
#UNK#
!

I
was
so
#UNK#
,
and
I
left
the
dinner
hungry
and
#UNK#
#UNK#
.

Good
Food

#UNK#
is
#UNK#
location
.

Even
the
#UNK#
,
which
I
#UNK#
find
too
dry
,
were
good
.

#UNK#
menu
selection
.

#UNK#
are
ok
,
but
be
sure
not
to
make
any
special
#UNK#
!

We
had
fun
eating
in
there
,
we
were
there
like
around
3
a
.
#UNK#
.
in
the
#UNK#
!

I
had
the
best
#UNK#
ever
.

My
boyfriend
and
I
are
#UNK#
restaurant
#UNK#
,
and
we
are
always
on
the
#UNK#
for
new
places
and
our
friend
had
recommended
Flatbush
#UNK#
.

#UNK#
was
a
little
#UNK#
but
still
delicious
with
goat
cheese
and
#UNK#
(
#UNK#
was
kind
of
#UNK#
though
)
.

If
your
looking
for
real
quality
(
not
the
#UNK#
that
is
seen
on
#UNK#
#UNK#
-
which
#UNK#
recently
got
in
#UNK#
for
"
#UNK#
"
#UNK#
)
,
you
need
to
get
in
here
!

I
#UNK#
recommend
.

I
thought
this
place
was
totally
#UNK#
.

The
#UNK#
are
dry
,
#UNK#
and
way
overpriced
.

The
pizza
’
s
are
light
and
#UNK#
.

I
had
a
taste
of
all
three
items
on
her
plate
,
and
they
were
superb
.

The
bagel
was
huge
.

awesome

If
you're
#UNK#
in
good
#UNK#
(
without
the
fish
taste
or
#UNK#
)
,
large
portions
and
creative
sushi
dishes
this
is
your
place
...

I
will
never
return
again
.

I
will
give
them
another
chance
and
make
sure
to
tell
them
to
#UNK#
it
up
several
#UNK#
.

It
looked
like
#UNK#
cheese
#UNK#
done
-
still
in
#UNK#
.

Go
there
once
and
#UNK#
yes
...
you
will
go
back
...
you
will
...

This
place
,
which
is
only
a
few
months
old
,
is
#UNK#
#UNK#
'
#UNK#
#UNK#
!

we
ordered
the
#UNK#
#UNK#
prawns
which
we
always
order
at
every
#UNK#
restaurant
to
#UNK#
the
quality
of
food
.

#UNK#
.

This
place
#UNK#
me
away
...
by
far
my
new
favorite
restaurant
on
the
#UNK#
side
.

On
my
meal
I
had
to
#UNK#
back
my
eggs
for
a
simple
#UNK#
of
#UNK#
the
#UNK#
before
#UNK#
,
and
would
have
had
to
#UNK#
them
back
again
if
I
#UNK#
#UNK#
the
meal
all
together
.

#UNK#
is
a
good
restaurant
,
but
it's
nothing
special
.

#UNK#
romantic
#UNK#
with
only
around
15
tables
at
most
.

My
friend
got
the
mushroom
pizza
which
tasted
better
.

Always
great
service
!

Maybe
#UNK#
#UNK#

If
#UNK#
make
you
#UNK#
,
then
your
in
for
a
#UNK#
,
but
if
your
like
most
around
these
#UNK#
then
#UNK#
just
#UNK#
and
#UNK#
#UNK#
with
all
the
#UNK#
.

Its
location
is
good
and
the
fact
that
#UNK#
#UNK#
is
#UNK#
and
their
prices
are
very
reasonable
,
makes
#UNK#
go
back
to
Suan
again
and
again
.

This
is
a
fun
restaurant
to
go
to
.

#UNK#
Sushi
in
NYC

Great
food
!

We
ate
outside
at
#UNK#
#UNK#
bar
because
#UNK#
restaurant
next
#UNK#
was
#UNK#
.

Highly
recommended
.

Excellent
sashimi
,
and
the
#UNK#
roll
is
#UNK#
delicious
.

The
service
was
excellent
-
friendly
and
attentive
.

Great
sushi
experience
.

The
#UNK#
have
been
at
the
restaurant
for
years
and
#UNK#
family
#UNK#
.

#UNK#
the
steak
came
,
the
server
told
us
that
the
steak
did
not
come
with
any
#UNK#
and
#UNK#
I
#UNK#
something
from
the
menu
.

#UNK#
#UNK#
disappointed
.

The
#UNK#
is
fantastic
,
#UNK#
,
&
extremely
#UNK#
.

The
pancakes
should
be
#UNK#
(
at
least
8
"
)
to
#UNK#
the
#UNK#
even
with
the
unique
#UNK#
.

Well
...
they
can
run
but
they
can't
#UNK#
.

#UNK#
,
mind
#UNK#
#UNK#
.

Ray's
is
something
of
a
Seattle
#UNK#
,
but
given
its
#UNK#
#UNK#
#UNK#
,
I
had
#UNK#
that
the
#UNK#
were
more
#UNK#
to
the
#UNK#
than
to
the
food
and
service
.

Everyone
that
sat
in
the
back
outside
#UNK#
that
it
was
the
worst
service
we
had
ever
received
.

#UNK#
I
say
more
?

If
I
want
to
#UNK#
in
line
on
Sunday
for
an
hour
to
get
average
brunch
food
,
then
I
would
put
#UNK#
at
the
top
of
the
list
.

The
#UNK#
and
#UNK#
as
party
#UNK#
is
a
cute
and
sweet
#UNK#
to
a
most
#UNK#
meal
.

#UNK#
#UNK#
is
my
favorite
Indian
restaurant
in
the
city
.

I
went
with
#UNK#
.

My
#UNK#
and
I
dine
at
Bukhara
often
as
she
#UNK#
#UNK#
it
.

At
first
we
were
a
little
taken
#UNK#
,
as
this
seemed
to
#UNK#
a
problem
,
although
the
restaurant
looked
fairly
empty
,
but
they
#UNK#
put
the
table
together
for
us
.

#UNK#
not
try
unless
you're
just
going
there
to
hang
out
like
the
#UNK#
of
the
#UNK#
who
#UNK#
have
no
sense
of
taste
.

It
is
very
overpriced
and
not
very
tasty
.

I
had
a
great
experience
.

#UNK#
the
#UNK#
#UNK#
was
,
they
were
on
#UNK#
.

The
decor
in
this
place
is
very
#UNK#
and
the
kind
of
place
you
expect
in
the
#UNK#
Village
-
not
romantic
,
just
simple
,
small
and
#UNK#
.

We
used
to
#UNK#
most
of
their
restaurants
but
over
the
years
each
one
has
really
been
#UNK#
.

All
the
people
that
I
bring
there
go
back
on
their
own
and
bring
#UNK#
friends
!

The
waitress
,
seems
to
be
more
#UNK#
of
looking
good
than
actually
#UNK#
.

#UNK#
#UNK#
of
bathroom
,
the
#UNK#
bathroom
was
disgusting
.

As
of
#UNK#
this
I
just
tried
their
give
away
a
#UNK#
again
&
it
still
doesn't
work
.

The
best
pad
#UNK#
i've
ever
had
.

I
will
be
out
with
friends
and
all
of
a
#UNK#
I
am
hungry
and
I
only
#UNK#
one
thing
...
their
Pizza
.

Also
,
they
do
not
take
#UNK#
#UNK#
so
come
with
#UNK#
!

The
decor
is
night
#UNK#
...
but
they
#UNK#
need
to
clean
that
#UNK#
in
the
#UNK#
...
its
quite
#UNK#
,
and
#UNK#
your
#UNK#
to
make
this
place
look
#UNK#
and
modern
.

I
don't
know
#UNK#
anyone
would
want
to
write
a
great
review
about
this
place
.

By
the
time
we
left
our
#UNK#
were
#UNK#
and
so
were
our
#UNK#
#UNK#
we
#UNK#
the
#UNK#
we
were
#UNK#
to
see
#UNK#
our
dinner
,
which
would
have
been
#UNK#
if
we
got
to
enjoy
the
experience
of
good
food
and
belly
#UNK#
!

#UNK#
you
#UNK#
#UNK#
me
?

With
so
many
great
breakfast
/
lunch
places
in
So
#UNK#
,
this
one
is
not
worth
the
wait
or
any
extra
#UNK#
to
visit
.

She
#UNK#
to
#UNK#
to
the
waitress
who
had
#UNK#
off
in
a
#UNK#
,
but
we
could
#UNK#
take
her
#UNK#
#UNK#
,
#UNK#
as
she
#UNK#
#UNK#
to
get
the
#UNK#
name
.

The
atmosphere
is
nothing
special
,
but
it
#UNK#
like
a
Sushi
establishment
in
#UNK#
.

Once
you're
inside
,
the
real
experience
#UNK#
.

#UNK#
on
.

When
I'm
feeling
#UNK#
by
the
#UNK#
and
#UNK#
around
my
#UNK#
,
I
#UNK#
for
Cafe
St
.
#UNK#
.

$
6
and
there
is
much
tasty
food
,
all
of
it
fresh
and
#UNK#
#UNK#
.

Always
good
.

Loved
it
!

The
portions
are
large
and
the
servers
always
#UNK#
us
with
a
different
#UNK#
.

The
only
#UNK#
on
this
restaurant
is
the
prices
.

#UNK#
-
its
real
food
for
people
who
love
the
best
.

The
prices
are
#UNK#
#UNK#
.

Good
for
#UNK#
or
with
friends
.

Also
,
waiters
try
to
#UNK#
more
food
on
you
,
like
#UNK#
things
as
if
they
are
#UNK#
when
they
actually
cost
$
.

#UNK#
time
,
we
wouldn't
#UNK#
ordering
anything
else
other
than
some
simple
#UNK#
appetizers
and
drinks
.

#UNK#
sushi
!

The
#UNK#
waiters
in
town
.

We
will
be
back
.

#UNK#
some
good
#UNK#
Chinese
food
at
incredible
prices
...

#UNK#

#UNK#
,
attentive
wait
staff
.

Love
this
place
,
every
time
we
are
in
the
city
this
is
one
of
the
places
we
always
go
.

Yes
,
they
use
#UNK#
ingredients
,
but
even
#UNK#
ingredients
don't
make
for
good
pizza
unless
someone
#UNK#
how
to
get
the
crust
right
.

The
menu
is
fairly
simple
without
much
#UNK#
.

I
will
be
going
back
and
#UNK#
recommend
it
!

#UNK#
on
the
menu
is
less
than
amazing
.

#UNK#
on
Park
#UNK#
is
simply
disgusting
.

It's
the
perfect
spot
for
a
romantic
date
for
2
or
a
#UNK#
#UNK#
!

I
#UNK#
even
enjoy
the
mashed
potatoes
because
it
was
#UNK#
completely
#UNK#
the
chicken
and
spinach
.

Don't
go
with
a
#UNK#
group
than
4
!

Had
a
late
night
dinner
on
a
Saturday
night
.

#UNK#
is
one
of
my
favorite
restaurants
in
the
City
;
the
place
the
#UNK#
reviews
describe
#UNK#
like
they
were
#UNK#
else
.

If
I
#UNK#
to
name
some
they
would
#UNK#
the
location
to
the
#UNK#
or
#UNK#
#UNK#
#UNK#
.

I
expected
quite
a
bit
more
from
such
an
expensive
menu
.

30
minutes
went
by
and
sure
enough
the
#UNK#
#UNK#
went
off
.

#UNK#
#UNK#
!

The
menu
is
#UNK#
but
almost
all
of
the
dishes
are
excellent
.

You
#UNK#
see
Indian
#UNK#
and
friends
dining
there
,
which
is
always
a
good
#UNK#
.

The
food
is
wonderful
,
tasty
and
#UNK#
,
and
the
service
is
#UNK#
and
friendly
.

The
#UNK#
salad
I
ordered
had
so
much
#UNK#
I
#UNK#
eat
it
.

Pizza
-
the
only
pizza
in
NYC
that
should
not
have
#UNK#
toppings
-
the
crust
#UNK#
like
the
best
,
#UNK#
#UNK#
bread
!

–
It
is
#UNK#
to
see
a
place
that
was
once
"
THE
"
place
to
#UNK#
and
eat
for
#UNK#
or
#UNK#
,
now
be
the
place
that
is
a
big
"
#UNK#
#UNK#
.
"

In
the
evening
,
this
place
#UNK#
a
well
#UNK#
,
with
it
,
NY
crowd
.

This
establishment
is
the
real
deal
.

#UNK#
at
#UNK#
#UNK#
#UNK#
.

Service
was
good
and
food
is
wonderful
.

Nice
for
one
time
special
occasion
.

I
had
yummy
lamb
#UNK#
,
#UNK#
#UNK#
,
#UNK#
,
#UNK#
,
etc
.

It
#UNK#
me
of
those
great
little
restaurants
in
#UNK#
#UNK#
.

I
was
there
for
brunch
recently
,
and
we
were
#UNK#
#UNK#
by
a
waitress
and
a
waiter
.

But
the
staff
was
so
horrible
to
us
.

#UNK#
,
the
rice
had
no
#UNK#
,
so
the
sushi
was
bland
and
disgusting
.

This
was
a
great
#UNK#
.

It's
one
of
our
favorite
places
to
eat
in
NY
.

#UNK#
is
too
dry
,
tuna
wasn't
so
fresh
either
.

A
#UNK#
!

Great
Indian
food

–
The
food
is
here
is
incredible
,
though
the
quality
is
#UNK#
during
lunch
.

Food
is
excellent
.

#UNK#
who
#UNK#
this
place
must
be
from
a
different
#UNK#
,
where
#UNK#
,
dry
and
#UNK#
are
#UNK#
.

#UNK#
a

The
pizza
is
yummy
and
I
like
the
#UNK#
.

#UNK#
take
my
#UNK#
,
go
and
try
this
place
.

Just
because
it's
cheap
does
NOT
mean
the
portions
are
small
or
the
food
is
#UNK#
,
IT
#UNK#
#UNK#
!

#UNK#
,
the
#UNK#
#UNK#
'
,
was
totally
#UNK#
and
always
on
top
of
things
.

This
dish
is
my
favorite
and
I
always
get
it
when
I
go
there
and
never
get
#UNK#
of
it
.

Also
,
#UNK#
if
you
like
your
food
spicy
-
its
rather
bland
if
you
don't
.

and
all
you
other
people
that
have
a
problem
get
some
#UNK#

The
lobster
sandwich
is
good
and
the
#UNK#
with
#UNK#
and
#UNK#
is
great
.

I
found
the
food
to
be
outstanding
,
#UNK#
the
salmon
dish
I
had
.

You
should
#UNK#
on
the
#UNK#
.

She
had
heard
from
a
#UNK#
about
this
place
.

Service
was
very
good
-
prompt
,
attentive
and
#UNK#
.

I
have
been
to
#UNK#
twice
and
both
times
were
very
#UNK#
.

Never
had
one
#UNK#
problem
there
.

I
#UNK#
you
won't
be
disappointed
,
there's
also
#UNK#
#UNK#
.

the
food
was
great
,
the
margaritas
too
but
the
waitress
was
too
busy
being
nice
to
her
other
#UNK#
party
than
to
take
better
#UNK#
of
my
friend
and
me
.

#UNK#
food
and
service

Great
#UNK#

This
restaurant
used
to
be
our
regular
#UNK#
night
dinner
location
.

We
ordered
the
chicken
#UNK#
,
but
what
we
got
were
a
few
small
pieces
of
chicken
,
all
#UNK#
meat
and
on
the
#UNK#
.

The
appetizers
are
also
delicious
!

The
#UNK#
is
very
#UNK#
and
you
will
see
a
lot
of
#UNK#
guys
with
#UNK#
#UNK#
or
just
highly
paid
#UNK#
.

#UNK#
take
#UNK#
:
a
new
and
#UNK#
#UNK#
of
#UNK#
is
#UNK#
and
#UNK#
right
here
in
Brooklyn
.

overpriced
japanese
food
with
mediocre
service

You
will
not
be
#UNK#
at
all
.

#UNK#
now
,
#UNK#
or
#UNK#
#UNK#
into
the
"
#UNK#
"
#UNK#
.

The
sushi
was
excellent
and
the
wait
staff
was
quick
.

But
too
far
east
!

The
entree
was
bland
and
small
,
dessert
was
not
#UNK#
.

Poor
customer
service
/
poor
pizza
.

The
wait
here
is
long
for
#UNK#
sum
,
but
if
you
don't
like
#UNK#
tables
or
if
the
#UNK#
#UNK#
#UNK#
sum
atmosphere
is
not
your
#UNK#
,
this
is
a
#UNK#
(
for
#UNK#
)
#UNK#
.

However
,
I
think
this
place
is
a
good
hang
out
spot
.

Service
is
not
what
one
would
expect
from
a
joint
in
this
price
#UNK#
.

#UNK#
-
relaxed
and
#UNK#
.

Oh
,
and
I
never
write
#UNK#
just
was
so
#UNK#
by
how
bad
this
place
was
,
I
felt
it
was
my
#UNK#
to
#UNK#
the
#UNK#
.

A
cozy
spot
for
2

Never
have
I
had
such
#UNK#
delivery
guys
(
a
lot
of
#UNK#
and
#UNK#
and
#UNK#
#UNK#
#UNK#
#UNK#
/
#UNK#
I
live
in
a
#UNK#
)
who
always
seem
disappointed
with
their
#UNK#
.

we
love
#UNK#
#UNK#
#UNK#
.

Service
was
prompt
and
#UNK#
.

#UNK#
salad
was
superb
.

In
#UNK#
outside
on
a
#UNK#
(
another
great
#UNK#
of
Suan
)
!
!
!

Toons
has
recently
been
#UNK#
,
so
it's
now
a
very
#UNK#
space
.

#UNK#
#UNK#
#UNK#
were
seated
#UNK#
us
for
the
first
part
of
our
dinner
...
they
were
#UNK#
by
a
#UNK#
#UNK#
who
#UNK#
to
#UNK#
every
time
seafood
was
#UNK#
at
her
table
.

In
#UNK#
/
#UNK#
#UNK#
/
#UNK#
Village
this
is
my
#UNK#
and
my
favorite
spot
.

The
#UNK#
decor
and
#UNK#
#UNK#
made
for
a
good
#UNK#
.

The
food
was
ok
and
fair
nothing
to
go
#UNK#
.

there
was
a
guy
playing
the
#UNK#
and
#UNK#
at
the
bar
area
which
was
#UNK#
from
the
dinning
area
.

When
asked
about
how
a
#UNK#
dish
was
prepared
in
#UNK#
to
a
#UNK#
at
other
#UNK#
restaurants
,
he
replied
this
is
not
#UNK#
,
every
place
makes
things
#UNK#

We
went
to
celebrate
two
#UNK#
and
wanted
to
do
something
special
and
different
.

Just
remember
,
the
later
you
go
,
the
#UNK#
you
may
have
to
wait
.

The
#UNK#
was
pretty
tasty
and
good
on
a
hot
#UNK#
day
.

#UNK#
#UNK#
#UNK#
#UNK#
!
!
!

But
she
is
very
friendly
with
#UNK#
people
,
#UNK#
it
even
more
#UNK#
.

I
have
to
#UNK#
with
the
previous
#UNK#
.

As
a
#UNK#
#UNK#
,
I
can
say
with
some
#UNK#
of
#UNK#
that
for
the
last
year
#UNK#
#UNK#
has
been
the
best
#UNK#
late
night
in
the
city
.

Great
value
sushi
with
high
quality
&
nice
setting
.

This
is
the
#UNK#
wonderful
restaurant
in
all
of
New
York
City
,
not
just
Brooklyn
...

great
for
a
romantic
evening
,
or
a
fun
evening
with
friends
...

Casa
La
Femme
is
to
#UNK#
#UNK#
dining
what
#UNK#
#UNK#
is
to
#UNK#
.

–
A
#UNK#
friend
recently
visited
and
our
group
of
three
just
had
to
come
for
dinner
.

The
service
is
good
and
ambience
is
good
for
a
date
or
group
#UNK#
.

There
were
no
#UNK#
#UNK#
either
,
as
she
#UNK#
perfect
#UNK#
.

the
food
is
always
fresh
...

#UNK#
...

Overall
I
would
recommend
it
and
go
back
again
.

i
would
#UNK#
not
#UNK#
the
#UNK#
when
i
order
these
#UNK#
of
food
but
for
the
first
time
,
every
piece
was
as
#UNK#
as
the
first
one
...
the
scallops
and
prawns
was
so
fresh
and
#UNK#
cooked
.

Save
your
money
and
your
time
and
go
#UNK#
else
.

No
#UNK#
!
!
!

A
little
crowded
but
they
#UNK#
that
line
really
fast
!

#UNK#
of
a
small
place
but
I
guess
if
they
are
not
too
busy
might
be
able
to
#UNK#
a
group
or
#UNK#
.

great
food
,
great
wine
list
,
great
service
in
a
great
neighborhood

Service
/
#UNK#

next
one
that
we
ordered
were
prawns
and
#UNK#
with
#UNK#
.

When
we
finally
were
able
to
#UNK#
someone
down
,
it
was
someone
#UNK#
different
from
the
person
who
had
#UNK#
off
the
food
,
who
was
also
not
the
same
person
who
had
taken
our
order
.

They
seemed
to
#UNK#
to
#UNK#
us
#UNK#
,
#UNK#
plates
without
asking
if
we
were
done
(
my
sister
still
had
her
#UNK#
in
hand
)
.

#UNK#
the
atmosphere
-
felt
like
I
was
in
#UNK#
.

The
side
of
potatoes
is
to
die
for
,
as
is
the
#UNK#
(
#UNK#
#UNK#
)
.

I
think
I
have
probably
tried
each
#UNK#
on
their
menu
at
least
once
it
is
all
excellent
.

#UNK#
#UNK#
spot
in
Park
#UNK#
,
the
sushi
is
#UNK#
good
,
the
service
is
pleasant
,
#UNK#
and
#UNK#
.

The
service
is
really
attentive
and
charming
.

best
restaurant
in
the
world
,
great
decor
,
great
customer
service
,
friendly
manager

Well
,
I
guess
maybe
it
might
be
#UNK#
for
the
management
to
pay
a
visit
to
#UNK#
#UNK#
in
#UNK#
City
for
some
#UNK#
.

Restaurant
with
a
view

I
wish
I
could
like
this
place
more
,
and
I
wish
someone
would
#UNK#
the
staff
.

The
atmosphere
was
great
.

The
#UNK#
#UNK#
is
a
great
#UNK#
,
they
fix
it
for
you
at
the
table
.

The
#UNK#
#UNK#
and
#UNK#
.

For
the
#UNK#
of
food
we
got
the
prices
should
have
been
#UNK#
.

Delicious
...
!

They
#UNK#
the
most
#UNK#
,
but
#UNK#
I've
been
there
they
have
been
very
busy
,
which
probably
#UNK#
for
the
#UNK#
of
conversation
.

The
food
is
amazing
...
especially
if
you
get
the
#UNK#
#UNK#
menu
and
your
#UNK#
bottle
(
or
two
!
)
of
wine
from
an
extensive
selection
of
wines
.

Try
#UNK#
#UNK#
roll
.

A
large
is
$
20
,
and
toppings
are
about
$
3
each
.

The
#UNK#
were
good
but
I
have
had
far
better
pancakes
at
a
#UNK#
#UNK#
specialty
restaurant
that
were
a
little
#UNK#
but
#UNK#
#UNK#
.

First
of
all
,
this
place
is
#UNK#
not
#UNK#
romantic
,
as
#UNK#
by
#UNK#
#UNK#
review
.

I
have
not
a
bad
thing
to
say
about
this
place
.

(
She
was
actually
going
to
take
me
to
another
#UNK#
restaurant
right
across
the
street
but
they
were
not
open
yet
even
though
it
was
a
few
minutes
past
their
#UNK#
time
.
)

The
service
#UNK#
from
day
to
day
-
sometimes
they're
very
nice
,
and
sometimes
not
.

#UNK#
in
,
the
atmosphere
#UNK#
it
,
but
at
your
#UNK#
,
it's
a
very
#UNK#
experience
.

Once
you
try
it
for
a
special
occasion
#UNK#
..
you
can't
stop
!

I
#UNK#
been
to
the
other
#UNK#
.

The
price
was
right
too
.

Try
the
#UNK#
#UNK#
for
sushi
as
the
#UNK#
#UNK#
was
incredible
and
the
rolls
were
also
tasty
.

I
have
eaten
at
Saul
,
many
times
,
the
food
is
always
#UNK#
,
#UNK#
good
.

This
is
the
place
to
#UNK#
and
enjoy
the
#UNK#
quality
food
the
#UNK#
can
offer
.

On
a
hot
day
it
was
fabulous
to
stop
in
and
enjoy
lunch
.

Never
got
an
#UNK#
as
to
what
was
going
on
.

had
many
dishes
but
the
BEST
was
the
lobster
3
#UNK#
.

We
waited
over
30
minutes
for
our
drinks
and
over
1
#UNK#
#UNK#
for
our
food
.

And
even
with
it's
#UNK#
atmosphere
they
were
great
to
my
#UNK#
too
!

The
crowd
is
#UNK#
#UNK#
,
young
and
old
.

The
service
was
friendly
and
the
atmosphere
was
casual
.

We
put
in
our
order
and
although
we
ordered
4
appetizers
,
the
food
didn't
#UNK#
#UNK#
#UNK#
minutes
later
...
#UNK#
#UNK#
#UNK#
#UNK#
.

#UNK#
is
so
cute
and
#UNK#
,
good
for
business
although
we
were
there
on
#UNK#
.

My
#UNK#
was
perfect
,
my
was
well
done
and
dry
.

Went
to
this
place
this
place
on
a
real
cold
night
and
#UNK#
a
quick
meal
.

#UNK#
at
this
restaurant
will
give
#UNK#
#UNK#
about
anything
and
in
the
end
,
not
one
person
#UNK#
#UNK#
for
anything
.

I
would
definitely
recommend
#UNK#
if
you
like
#UNK#
cuisine
!

The
food
was
average
to
#UNK#
;
the
French
#UNK#
soup
#UNK#
yet
not
#UNK#
impressive
,
and
the
desserts
not
#UNK#
in
any
way
.

It
is
#UNK#
and
slightly
soggy
.

Great
open
and
friendly
ambience
.

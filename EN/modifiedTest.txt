When
I
called
this
#UNK#
,
I
didn't
think
I
would
be
able
to
get
in
at
#UNK#
,
but
I
was
able
to
get
in
,
#UNK#
with
four
other
guests
.

The
tuna
and
#UNK#
potatoes
are
excellent
.

My
#UNK#
pizza
joint
in
Seattle

Food
#UNK#
,
its
ok
but
a
bit
pricey
for
what
you
get
considering
the
restaurant
#UNK#
a
#UNK#
place
.

–
#UNK#
away
over
by
the
#UNK#
#UNK#
.

My
mouth
felt
very
dry
#UNK#
and
I
had
that
#UNK#
?
#UNK#
?
taste
#UNK#
in
my
#UNK#
after
I
left
the
restaurant
.

It's
a
tiny
place
so
if
you
get
there
before
#UNK#
#UNK#
on
a
#UNK#
(
#UNK#
?
#UNK#
)
you
will
find
it
#UNK#
to
get
a
table
or
a
seat
at
the
sushi
bar
.

The
wine
list
is
wonderful
and
the
food
#UNK#
me
of
my
#UNK#
trip
to
#UNK#
.

We
all
#UNK#
that
#UNK#
is
one
of
the
best
seafood
restaurants
in
New
York
.

#UNK#
it
#UNK#
!

We
have
since
#UNK#
and
also
had
a
great
experience
,
#UNK#
more
small
plates
and
a
variety
of
the
beer
(
cold
and
good
)
.

#UNK#
to
#UNK#
,
#UNK#
offers
a
less
#UNK#
bagel
!

It
was
so
much
though
that
I
could
barely
#UNK#
but
I
did
,
since
it
was
delicious
.

the
staff
was
very
nice
and
#UNK#
and
#UNK#
#UNK#
.

This
was
,
from
start
to
#UNK#
,
a
#UNK#
#UNK#
experience
.

I
went
here
with
a
friend
on
a
#UNK#
,
we
went
#UNK#
else
first
and
#UNK#
get
a
table
.

We
#UNK#
with
#UNK#
chocolate
cake
,
both
were
delicious
.

Not
much
of
a
selection
of
#UNK#
beer
either
,
we
went
with
#UNK#
.

–
This
review
is
for
the
#UNK#
location
which
is
not
listed
in
#UNK#
:
I
wish
this
review
would
make
a
#UNK#
enough
for
it
to
be
#UNK#
by
management
but
#UNK#
has
people
#UNK#
over
each
other
for
a
chance
to
eat
at
this
overpriced
restaurant
with
mediocre
food
and
service
,
so
this
review
as
well
as
the
other
#UNK#
#UNK#
for
their
#UNK#
location
will
go
#UNK#
.

I'll
be
back
for
sure
.

Good
#UNK#

The
#UNK#
is
always
fresh
too
.

Although
we
were
looking
for
regular
#UNK#
and
some
#UNK#
the
salads
we
got
were
great
.

We've
tried
before
but
it
always
packed
and
doesn't
take
reservations
.

#UNK#
experience
.

Good
drink
.

There
is
"
#UNK#
"
and
there
is
"
#UNK#
"
?

And
it
was
quick
which
is
very
#UNK#
.

this
little
place
has
a
cute
interior
decor
and
#UNK#
city
prices
.

The
location
and
ambience
is
#UNK#
but
the
food
is
what
makes
up
for
it
.

I
#UNK#
just
got
back
home
after
visiting
Casa
La
Femme
and
was
so
#UNK#
by
my
visit
felt
it
#UNK#
to
try
and
#UNK#
other
#UNK#
who
value
their
money
and
time
.

The
place
itself
is
beautiful
the
bar
scene
seems
to
be
#UNK#
.

Also
,
the
#UNK#
(
#UNK#
$
7
)
didn't
come
with
anything
like
#UNK#
or
a
side
.

The
stuff
#UNK#
was
#UNK#
...
tasted
like
#UNK#
.

You
can
#UNK#
hear
him
though
so
it
was
a
pleasant
#UNK#
and
not
#UNK#
.

It's
#UNK#
not
a
place
to
go
if
you
want
to
#UNK#
someone
.

The
lamb
was
#UNK#
so
full
of
flavor
,
the
dessert
was
#UNK#
!
!

Great
vibe
,
#UNK#
of
people
.

To
start
things
off
,
our
lovely
server
#UNK#
was
quickly
on
hand
to
take
my
drink
order
.

We
#UNK#
to
pay
for
it
because
at
this
point
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
food
#UNK#
.

The
#UNK#
was
some
of
the
best
I've
had
and
I
really
enjoyed
the
#UNK#
,
not
too
#UNK#
.

#UNK#
food
-
if
the
front
of
house
staff
don't
put
you
off
–

#UNK#
#UNK#
Restaurant
in
Manhattan

#UNK#
is
a
little
#UNK#
,
but
to
be
expected
.

However
,
they
do
take
your
#UNK#
#UNK#
so
that
you
can
go
hang
out
#UNK#
else
#UNK#
they
#UNK#
you
up
on
your
#UNK#
.

Go
to
japanese
sushi
place
or
#UNK#
#UNK#
place
-
this
#UNK#
in
#UNK#
is
a
#UNK#
.

Not
one
to
#UNK#
to
#UNK#
(
#UNK#
my
#UNK#
of
previous
#UNK#
#UNK#
)
,
I
called
the
restaurant
to
give
them
a
#UNK#
up
that
their
#UNK#
might
want
to
check
the
#UNK#
of
their
#UNK#
#UNK#
.

I'm
#UNK#
I
was
#UNK#
to
this
place
and
this
is
a
#UNK#
gem
in
NY
.

It's
a
rather
#UNK#
and
busy
restaurant
and
it
#UNK#
early
.

The
food
is
fantastic
,
authentic
,
delicious
and
very
,
very
#UNK#
.

#UNK#
...
good
!

But
$
500
for
a
dinner
for
two
that
didn't
#UNK#
#UNK#
?

The
staff
offers
#UNK#
service
.

Great
Indian
Food
!

–
As
with
most
restaurants
in
Seattle
,
#UNK#
service
was
bad
and
the
food
was
overpriced
.

Great
#UNK#
and
bottle
selection
and
the
pizza
#UNK#
.

We
went
to
#UNK#
for
#UNK#
.

The
wait
staff
is
pleasant
,
fun
,
and
for
the
most
part
#UNK#
(
in
the
wonderful
#UNK#
#UNK#
way
,
not
in
that
#UNK#
#UNK#
#UNK#
$
#UNK#
way
)
.

There
is
something
about
their
atmosphere
that
makes
me
come
back
nearly
every
week
.

The
last
two
times
I
ordered
from
here
my
food
was
#UNK#
spicy
that
I
could
barely
eat
it
,
and
the
#UNK#
took
away
from
the
flavor
of
the
dish
.

#UNK#
#UNK#
,
this
is
some
of
the
worst
sushi
I
have
ever
tried
.

If
I
could
give
#UNK#
#UNK#
I
would
do
so
for
this
place
.

I
have
never
before
eaten
#UNK#
pieces
of
#UNK#
good
#UNK#
.

When
family
came
in
he
#UNK#
them
#UNK#
to
#UNK#
their
#UNK#
,
and
then
ordered
for
them
.

With
the
#UNK#
of
our
#UNK#
salad
that
had
so
much
#UNK#
on
it
that
our
#UNK#
#UNK#
#UNK#
,
the
food
here
was
decent
,
not
great
.

What
a
great
place
.

My
friend
is
100
%
right
in
the
experience
we
had
.

The
#UNK#
of
the
#UNK#
sum
,
though
pricey
by
#UNK#
#UNK#
,
is
worth
it
.

#UNK#
of
the
time
it
seems
like
they
do
not
#UNK#
about
you
.

Best
In
#UNK#
of
NYC

#UNK#
me
.

And
where
does
#UNK#
go
wrong
;
no
where
.

This
is
#UNK#
my
favorite
modern
Japanese
#UNK#
(
that
#UNK#
’
t
serve
sushi
)
,
and
in
my
#UNK#
,
one
of
the
most
romantic
restaurants
in
the
city
!

My
husband
said
he
#UNK#
eaten
several
more
,
the
portion
was
fine
for
me
he
even
#UNK#
that
the
#UNK#
#UNK#
were
the
best
he
has
had
.

We
asked
for
#UNK#
which
the
waiter
than
#UNK#
that
he
#UNK#
to
put
in
that
part
of
our
order
.

I
am
#UNK#
my
#UNK#
family
back
next
time
.

#UNK#
are
overpriced
and
you
can
get
better
just
around
the
corner
:

After
dinner
the
manager
#UNK#
my
boyfriend
,
asked
him
:
#UNK#
are
you
from
...
maybe
you
dont
know
how
things
work
in
#UNK#
...
and
in
the
end
#UNK#
away
almost
#UNK#
#UNK#
that
#UNK#
are
the
only
thing
they
#UNK#
on
.

It
was
well
worth
the
wait
.

My
husband
and
I
#UNK#
it
would
be
great
to
go
to
the
#UNK#
and
#UNK#
#UNK#
for
our
anniversary
,
and
to
our
#UNK#
it
was
fantastic
.

My
wife
had
the
fried
shrimp
which
are
huge
and
loved
it
.

I
#UNK#
upon
this
great
#UNK#
as
I
#UNK#
my
new
neighborhood
.

It
?
s
served
with
either
a
#UNK#
sauce
or
#UNK#
wine
#UNK#
,
though
both
were
#UNK#
in
taste
.

The
food
was
absolutely
amazing
!
!

We
put
out
name
down
and
although
there
were
open
tables
we
were
told
that
#UNK#
be
a
30
#UNK#
wait
.

I
do
not
think
dinner
in
Manhattan
should
cost
$
#UNK#
where
I
am
not
#UNK#
off
my
#UNK#
.

lobster
was
good
,
nothing
spectacular
.

i
actually
feel
like
i
should
keep
it
a
#UNK#
.

Very
disappointed
.

Try
the
#UNK#
and
the
#UNK#
like
#UNK#
fried
#UNK#
they
#UNK#
#UNK#
#UNK#
#UNK#
,
a
delicious
and
sweet
#UNK#
bread
.

#UNK#
than
#UNK#
vegetarian
dish
,
the
chef
#UNK#
me
with
a
plate
of
#UNK#
#UNK#
(
#UNK#
sauce
,
#UNK#
,
or
any
#UNK#
or
#UNK#
presentation
)
.

In
the
end
you
end
up
with
a
fair
#UNK#
and
#UNK#
#UNK#
A
#UNK#
#UNK#
!
!
!

–
I
am
#UNK#
#UNK#
to
#UNK#
that
my
dinner
at
Ray's
#UNK#
last
Friday
completely
#UNK#
my
expectations
.

She
was
very
helpful
in
#UNK#
us
drinks
and
#UNK#
us
in
ordering
a
lot
of
good
dishes
since
we
#UNK#
nothing
about
Indian
food
.

Went
here
on
a
#UNK#
#UNK#
.

I
know
many
people
have
their
favorite
#UNK#
of
pizza
and
pizza
places
,
but
#UNK#
pizza
#UNK#
quality
and
good
taste
.

I
went
there
for
lunch
and
it
was
not
as
good
as
I
expected
from
the
reviews
I
#UNK#
.

What
a
#UNK#
!

This
place
must
have
cost
the
owners
#UNK#
to
#UNK#
.

On
the
way
out
,
we
heard
of
other
guests
#UNK#
about
#UNK#
#UNK#
.

The
portions
are
small
but
being
that
the
food
was
so
good
makes
up
for
that
.

We
all
felt
it
was
worth
it
.

Love
their
drink
menu
.

If
you
are
going
for
the
food
,
it
will
not
be
worth
it
.

Service
was
kind
of
slow
,
our
waitress
took
#UNK#
to
give
us
our
check
even
though
it
wasn't
that
busy
.

Its
worth
the
wait
,
especially
since
#UNK#
give
you
a
#UNK#
when
the
table
is
#UNK#
.

i
went
to
#UNK#
about
a
#UNK#
#UNK#
with
my
family
.

Service
is
average
.

One
would
think
#UNK#
get
an
apology
or
#UNK#
drinks
-
instead
,
we
got
a
#UNK#
waiter
wouldn't
even
take
our
order
for
15
minutes
and
#UNK#
us
#UNK#
when
we
asked
him
to
do
so
.

After
sitting
at
the
bar
for
over
20
minutes
the
bar
keep
had
made
only
2
drinks
&
kept
#UNK#
us
#UNK#
be
right
with
us
.

The
#UNK#
#UNK#
#UNK#
(
with
#UNK#
/
#UNK#
#UNK#
glasses
)
will
#UNK#
at
you
if
you
try
to
order
a
drink
.

If
it's
nice
outside
,
#UNK#
for
a
table
in
the
#UNK#
.

Dokebi
#UNK#
#UNK#
the
right
#UNK#
#UNK#
of
#UNK#
Korean
food
and
#UNK#
#UNK#
like
pork
belly
#UNK#
.

It
is
also
extremely
well
priced
.

this
place
...
we
#UNK#
upon
it
on
#UNK#
day
#UNK#
.

Went
on
a
3
day
oyster
#UNK#
,
with
#UNK#
#UNK#
up
the
#UNK#
,
and
I
am
so
#UNK#
this
was
the
place
it
#UNK#
trip
#UNK#
,
because
it
was
so
great
!

#UNK#
time
we
will
go
#UNK#
else
,
or
try
other
restaurants
close
by
like
#UNK#
Cafe
and
#UNK#
#UNK#
.

The
drinks
are
great
,
especially
when
made
by
#UNK#
.

Most
#UNK#
,
food
is
excellent
.

The
service
is
#UNK#
.

The
food
is
a
#UNK#
in
#UNK#
-
-
the
food
is
delicious
and
#UNK#
with
the
perfect
#UNK#
of
#UNK#
and
#UNK#
.

Went
here
last
night
-
nice
decor
,
good
service
,
but
the
food
was
#UNK#
excellent
.

If
there
is
a
line
very
day
of
the
week
for
the
entire
time
a
place
is
open
,
you
know
it
is
great
.

Everyone
seemed
generally
happy
with
their
food
,
except
my
#UNK#
who
had
the
#UNK#
#UNK#
#UNK#
,
#UNK#
#UNK#
in
#UNK#
#UNK#
!

The
bathroom
itself
is
very
small
with
two
#UNK#
and
only
one
#UNK#
,
the
#UNK#
was
#UNK#
totally
on
the
way
#UNK#
out
#UNK#
#UNK#
from
the
#UNK#
.

–
#UNK#
or
#UNK#
charming
location
#UNK#
the
#UNK#
in
#UNK#
#UNK#
and
average
food
does
not
,
#UNK#
,
#UNK#
for
its
very
poor
customer
service
.

The
pizza
was
slightly
#UNK#
of
#UNK#
#UNK#
pizza
which
#UNK#
the
the
space
years
#UNK#
(
a
#UNK#
second
)
.

The
restaurant
was
packed
at
first
,
so
we
waited
at
the
bar
for
about
20
minutes
before
we
were
seated
.

For
a
#UNK#
#UNK#
!

The
#UNK#
were
served
with
#UNK#
soup
and
rice
.

#UNK#
,
no
apology
,
no
is
there
anything
else
I
can
get
you
,
no
can
I
get
you
a
drink
to
make
up
for
it
,
nothing
!
!
!

#UNK#
there
while
on
#UNK#
and
#UNK#
the
reviews
.

A
must
try
!

#UNK#
#UNK#
!

This
is
a
wonderful
place
on
all
#UNK#
#UNK#
especially
value
#UNK#
money
.

#UNK#
the
wait

I've
been
many
time
and
have
never
been
disappointed
.

The
servers
#UNK#
the
#UNK#
are
always
friendly
and
helpful
.

We
were
fast
to
order
the
appetizer
platter
since
we
were
very
hungry
.

I
also
recommend
the
rice
dishes
or
the
different
#UNK#
of
#UNK#
(
rice
#UNK#
)
.

The
food
is
#UNK#
.

A
real
#UNK#
.

Love
#UNK#
#UNK#
La

The
only
thing
that
#UNK#
you
is
the
decor
?
(
not
very
pleasant
)
.

I
highly
recommend
it
.

Their
#UNK#
are
#UNK#
,
bad
,
#UNK#
,
#UNK#
.

I
#UNK#
my
friend
who
recommended
me
this
restaurant
and
will
certainly
recommend
it
to
#UNK#
.

#UNK#
you
pay
a
lot
and
don't
get
much
in
return
-
it's
#UNK#
,
things
are
expensive
.

The
service
was
#UNK#
and
attentive
.

Great
food
and
the
prices
are
very
reasonable
.

There
are
no
#UNK#
to
#UNK#
of
.

The
#UNK#
#UNK#
is
always
amazing
and
the
#UNK#
#UNK#
#UNK#
with
#UNK#
was
out
of
this
world
.

I
love
#UNK#
#UNK#
and
at
Ray's
you
can
get
them
served
in
about
6
different
#UNK#
!

I
probably
wouldn't
go
back
though
'
#UNK#
I
don't
know
if
it's
worth
it
.

This
place
has
the
the
#UNK#
ambience
and
an
excellent
staff
to
make
you
feel
like
a
#UNK#
and
a
friend
at
the
same
time
.

I
have
reservations
about
the
all
you
can
eat
deal
,
however
-
-
the
choices
are
fairly
#UNK#
and
you
can
probably
order
more
food
than
you
can
eat
for
less
than
$
#UNK#
by
just
going
off
the
menu
.

Service
,
however
,
was
excellent
...
and
I
liked
the
setting
/
atmosphere
a
lot
.

This
establishment
really
made
a
#UNK#
#UNK#
after
(
and
this
is
#UNK#
#UNK#
)
the
#UNK#
of
#UNK#
#UNK#
"
#UNK#
,
#UNK#
,
#UNK#
#UNK#
"
#UNK#
by
#UNK#
#UNK#
,
in
which
#UNK#
or
#UNK#
was
#UNK#
of
.

As
a
Japanese
#UNK#
,
I've
lived
in
the
#UNK#
area
for
over
8
years
,
but
I
was
just
so
#UNK#
at
this
place
.

For
the
people
who
want
great
food
#UNK#
great
service
,
#UNK#
is
a
place
to
#UNK#
!

please
don't
#UNK#
us
.

#UNK#
down
,
the
best
tuna
I
have
ever
had
.

The
#UNK#
was
excellent
,
especially
the
#UNK#
,
as
were
the
#UNK#
pasta
#UNK#
.

#UNK#
us
to
sit
anywhere
,
and
when
we
sat
he
said
the
table
was
#UNK#
.

#UNK#
!

I
know
because
I
live
nearby
.

The
soup
for
the
#UNK#
was
#UNK#
sauce
and
water
.

#UNK#
THE
PLACE

It
was
one
of
the
few
places
in
#UNK#
where
you
would
actually
walk
around
and
not
have
to
take
a
#UNK#
.

#UNK#
in
the
area
between
the
restaurant
and
the
#UNK#
,
#UNK#
were
#UNK#
around
while
their
#UNK#
#UNK#
wine
.

I
took
one
look
at
the
chicken
and
I
was
#UNK#
.

Great
#UNK#

fresh
restaurant
was
amazing
...
food
was
delicious
and
of
course
fresh
.

I
cannot
#UNK#
you
not
#UNK#
out
to
eat
there
.

Even
after
they
#UNK#
me
the
last
time
I
was
there
.

We
did
#UNK#
late
for
our
reservation
so
I
can
not
#UNK#
too
much
about
the
wait
for
a
table
.

I
have
been
twice
to
this
restaurant
.

The
#UNK#
were
fantastic
and
so
was
the
dessert
...
definitely
going
to
be
back
very
soon
.

Yes
,
I
ate
the
food
,
but
I
certainly
would
not
have
if
I
had
seen
the
maggot
before
eating
,
and
I
was
at
this
point
fairly
#UNK#
to
my
stomach
.

The
place
was
nice
and
#UNK#
.

I
have
it
a
4
instead
of
5
because
of
the
price
(
just
chicken
#UNK#
#UNK#
-
no
bread
of
rice
-
is
$
#UNK#
)
,
which
I
would
expect
at
a
#UNK#
Indian
restaurant
but
this
place
doesn't
have
an
#UNK#
feel
.

Our
server
was
very
#UNK#
and
friendly
.

But
for
the
Shabu
Shabu
,
you
won't
find
much
better
in
NY
.

As
a
#UNK#
in
#UNK#
i
need
a
place
to
eat
after
a
hard
day
of
work
so
usually
i
just
go
to
any
indian
#UNK#
#UNK#
by
.

Service
here
was
great
,
food
was
fantastic
.

I
wish
I
#UNK#
be
#UNK#
!

This
establishment
is
consistent
with
my
#UNK#
of
the
#UNK#
of
#UNK#
#UNK#
group
.

#UNK#
has
the
best
service
and
atmosphere
in
NYC
.

For
each
course
we
waited
over
#UNK#
hour
to
#UNK#
minutes
and
were
never
offered
a
drink
.

#UNK#
you
will
spend
at
least
$
#UNK#
a
#UNK#
,
I
expect
better
service
.

This
is
the
perfect
spot
for
#UNK#
friends
,
having
lunch
,
dinner
,
#UNK#
or
#UNK#
drinks
!

#UNK#
nice
and
quiet
,
small
but
enough
for
6
(
or
more
)
.

Not
only
is
it
an
#UNK#
getting
to
this
#UNK#
#UNK#
spot
,
once
you
#UNK#
the
#UNK#
#UNK#
#UNK#
,
the
#UNK#
and
intimate
#UNK#
will
make
you
feel
like
you
’
re
no
#UNK#
in
the
city
.

Even
though
the
place
is
not
beautiful
,
the
food
#UNK#
for
itself
.

The
#UNK#
#UNK#
are
out
of
this
world
and
I
love
that
#UNK#
!
!

Try
it
!

This
was
a
#UNK#
visit
and
#UNK#
definitely
be
back
again
.

My
#UNK#
and
I
#UNK#
#UNK#
this
#UNK#
place
the
other
night
and
had
a
great
time
!

#UNK#
was
very
cozy
and
cute
.

The
atmosphere
is
#UNK#
and
the
waiters
are
#UNK#
walking
around
#UNK#
things
as
fast
as
they
can
.

Best
#UNK#
I
ever
had
and
great
portion
without
being
#UNK#
.

The
#UNK#
restaurant
has
a
lot
going
for
it
.

It
is
one
the
#UNK#
outdoor
restaurants
I
have
ever
seen
in
#UNK#
am
from
#UNK#
and
this
place
#UNK#
the
#UNK#
in
my
#UNK#
.

The
two
#UNK#
#UNK#
left
quite
some
time
#UNK#
to
open
their
own
place
.

A
cool
bar
with
great
food
,
and
tons
of
excellent
beer
.

She
#UNK#
nearby
but
had
never
gone
to
this
establishment
#UNK#
that
it
might
be
too
#UNK#
.

The
menu
is
very
#UNK#
-
i
think
we
#UNK#
4
or
5
#UNK#
.

In
fact
,
it
#UNK#
he
is
going
to
go
#UNK#
at
any
#UNK#
.

#UNK#
to
be
a
tasty
experience
!
)

A
little
pricey
but
it
really
#UNK#
the
spot
on
a
Sunday
#UNK#
!

My
#UNK#
and
I
#UNK#
this
place
.

I
have
a
but
here
-
there
was
a
bathroom
#UNK#
in
the
#UNK#
which
was
#UNK#
.

The
hot
dogs
are
good
,
yes
,
but
the
reason
to
get
over
here
is
the
fantastic
pork
#UNK#
sandwich
,
perfect
on
its
#UNK#
#UNK#
#UNK#
.

It
was
#UNK#
he
#UNK#
’
t
really
#UNK#
.

I
thought
I
had
#UNK#
and
gone
to
#UNK#
.

The
food
is
prepared
quickly
and
#UNK#
.

This
place
has
the
best
Chinese
style
#UNK#
#UNK#
in
the
city
.

I
recommend
it
for
a
night
when
you
want
to
#UNK#
!
(
it
was
a
bit
expensive
)

We
were
then
#UNK#
inside
.

I
never
heard
back
from
anyone
more
than
a
month
#UNK#
.

We
got
a
little
#UNK#
from
the
sake
but
#UNK#
that
what
Saturday
nights
with
the
#UNK#
are
all
about
?

A
restaurant
that
doesn't
try
to
do
anything
except
serve
great
food
with
great
service
in
a
pleasant
atmosphere
.

In
#UNK#
,
#UNK#
or
#UNK#
#UNK#
have
#UNK#
less
about
our
being
at
their
establishment
.

As
#UNK#
the
#UNK#
didn't
#UNK#
in
#UNK#
,
although
it
#UNK#
#UNK#
on
#UNK#
and
selection
.

I
#UNK#
upon
this
second
floor
#UNK#
two
#UNK#
#UNK#
when
I
was
with
two
friends
in
town
from
L
.
A
.

I
think
I've
had
some
the
best
meals
of
my
#UNK#
at
#UNK#
.

–
Great
#UNK#
#UNK#
#UNK#
spot
.

I'll
keep
this
#UNK#
.

AMAZING
#UNK#
#UNK#
!
!
!

I'd
hate
for
#UNK#
to
go
to
Park
#UNK#
and
think
that
this
is
how
all
#UNK#
#UNK#
restaurants
are
like
.

I
got
#UNK#
in
my
food
2
times
of
then
!

Great
bagels
,
#UNK#
and
a
good
place
to
hang
out
in
.

My
#UNK#
year
old
loved
it
.

It's
very
spicy
but
not
#UNK#
.

I
had
#UNK#
#UNK#
with
#UNK#
#UNK#
.

#UNK#
staff
that
actually
#UNK#
you
enjoy
your
meal
and
the
#UNK#
you're
with
.

The
pizza
is
overpriced
and
soggy
.

You
Can't
Go
#UNK#
#UNK#
.

I
#UNK#
the
meal
with
the
#UNK#
dessert
of
a
#UNK#
and
chocolate
#UNK#
...
yummy
!

But
the
best
pork
#UNK#
I
ever
had
is
the
main
thing
.

#UNK#
has
#UNK#
food
and
a
nice
decor
at
reasonable
prices
.

I
am
#UNK#
to
write
because
I
would
not
want
my
#UNK#
of
a
pizza
place
to
#UNK#
#UNK#
.

To
be
completely
fair
,
the
only
#UNK#
#UNK#
was
the
food
,
which
was
above
average
,
but
#UNK#
make
up
for
all
the
other
#UNK#
of
#UNK#
.

#UNK#
service
,
food
ok
,
pricey

The
place
is
so
cool
and
the
service
is
prompt
and
#UNK#
.

This
is
the
kind
of
place
#UNK#
like
to
take
all
your
friends
to
and
still
keep
a
#UNK#
.

–
A
group
of
5
of
us
went
there
for
Sunday
brunch
and
sat
outside
.

The
food
was
actually
#UNK#
.

The
service
was
spectacular
as
the
waiter
#UNK#
everything
about
the
menu
and
his
#UNK#
were
amazing
!

#UNK#
guests
enjoyed
pizza
,
#UNK#
#UNK#
#UNK#
salad
and
fish
and
#UNK#
.

I
had
the
#UNK#
plate
and
I
enjoyed
it
.

love
the
food
.

This
#UNK#
and
romantic
#UNK#
is
at
the
top
of
my
Manhattan
restaurant
list
.

The
steak
was
done
to
my
#UNK#
#UNK#
(
#UNK#
#UNK#
)
and
was
nice
and
#UNK#
.

The
three
of
us
#UNK#
in
front
of
her
should
have
been
an
#UNK#
of
how
many
of
us
there
were
.

Service
was
prompt
,
friendly
and
great
.

#UNK#
menu
,
#UNK#
ingredients
,
#UNK#
fish
,
#UNK#
rice
.

However
,
it
is
#UNK#
too
good
to
not
#UNK#
it
.

We
got
most
of
it
back
at
home
with
us
.

This
is
by
far
my
favorite
place
in
the
neighborhood
.

Will
absolutely
visit
again
.

really
#UNK#
on
your
#UNK#
!

There
is
only
one
place
on
the
east
#UNK#
that
has
it
all
,
#UNK#
a
lot
more
.

food
was
fine
,
with
a
some
#UNK#
#UNK#
.

The
food
was
great
!

#UNK#
and
friendly
service
.
